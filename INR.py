''''
is to try and create a python like tester file to  see if we can obtain the international normalized ratio and the ptt of blood.
''''
#### variables ##### 
inr = 0.0
pt = 0.0
ptnom = 0.0
isitest=0
slope=0
isiref=0
user_data_low = 0.0
user_data_high = 0.0
tester_data =0.0
a=0
b=0
c=0
#### main program #####
user_data_low = input{'prompt the users to enter a two digit number '}
user_data_high = input{'prompt the users to enter a two digit number '}

### i got to figure out how to make INR calculation

inr = (pt/ptnom)^isitest



#### isi 

isitest = isiref*slope




### create the logirithm slope of a b and c

if(a < b ):


### slope

slope = (a-c)/(b-c)

#### writing it to a file then adding it to that and printing it out
